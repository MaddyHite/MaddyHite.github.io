# History of the Pittsburgh Steelers Timeline

 Here is a timeline of the Pittsburgh Steelers. They are one of the earliest teams founded and have remained a domiant force in the NFL for the past 50 years. Throughout their history, they have merged with other teams, created a new name, a new logo and have moved to three different stadiums. The Steelers hold the record of the most Super Bowls ever won by a team and are considered to have the most amount of fans of a team across the country. My sources are from NFL.com and Wikipedia  

# Increase in tuition at higher education schools in Pennsylvania
![Increase in tuition at higher education schools in Pennsylvania](https://github.com/MaddyHite/MaddyHite.github.io/blob/master/tuitionchartbuilder.png?raw=true)
 In this project I explored three different types of colleges (private university,public university and private college) and their tuition changes over the past 10 years. In my findings, I learned that although every rate went up, the small private college, Moravian college, had the highest overall percentage increase in tuition.

# Most Popular NFL Teams by State in the United States

In this project I wanted to discover what the most popular NFL team was in each state, since not every state has their own team and not every state's home team is the most popular one. What I found was that even the most popular teams (the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers) were underrepresented on the map even though they were ranked in the top 3 most popular teams nationwide. This was interesting because I found that many of the teams fanbase is localized by region and though it may seem like teams such as the Minnesota Vikings and the Kansas City Chiefs are widely popular, they are fact some of the least popular teams in the country; this is due to population density per state. In my research I found the most populated city per state (where the icons are located) then searched the travel time from that city to the state’s favorite NFL team’s stadium. My sources include CBSsports.com, Business Insider, Google Maps and Wikipedia. For images: Brandreps, Seeklogo, BleacherReport, NFL.com, Dribble and fbschedules.

The first graphic analyzes the top revenue producing football teams per institution, by state. This graphic is interesting because the top producing school, Notre Dame, is a private institution. Lately, there has been controversy surrounding public institutions profit in sports and what they do with the money they make. According to this graphic, there are multiple institutions in one state that rank among the top-25 revenue producing schools. In my opinion, I believe that some of money these public football teams make should go back into the community (for example education in inner city public schools) instead of building a college football empire. Today, student-athletes at these schools are treated like professional football players instead of students and I think that this not only takes away from their own college experience, but it also puts other students at these universities at a disadvantage. 
The second graphic compares the total amount of athletic aid allocated to both men’s and women’s teams per college institution in 2016. I found this interesting because not only was there an very large gap by sometimes millions of dollars comparing men’s to women’s teams, there are some institutions that give no athletic aid at all, though these are some of the richest colleges in the country (Amherst College, etc). However, there were even some institutions that have a significant amount more money allocated towards women’s financial athletic aid. This is because these schools do not have a football team. The large gap between these two is much in part due to both football and men’s basketball. My Data is from NCAA site of consolidated data and is from 2016.
