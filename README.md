 Here is a timeline of the Pittsburgh Steelers. They are one of the earliest teams founded and have remained a domiant force in the NFL for the past 50 years. Throughout their history, they have merged with other teams, created a new name, a new logo and have moved to three different stadiums. The Steelers hold the record of the most Super Bowls ever won by a team and are considered to have the most amount of fans of a team across the country. My sources are from NFL.com and Wikipedia

In my findings, I learned that although every rate went up, the small private college, Moravian college, had the highest overall percentage increase in tuition.
